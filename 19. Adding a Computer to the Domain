Adding a Computer to the Domain:

- Right-click on this computer -> Properties -> Enter the domain name.
- Log in by entering the domain/username and password.
- The server automatically registers its hostname via DNS.
- If we add a new user to the domain, they will automatically register in the Computers OU unit.
- However, if we create a computer that will join the domain in the OU we created:
  "New -> Computer -> <computerName>", the computer registered with <computerName> will be directly registered in that OU.
