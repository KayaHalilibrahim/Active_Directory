Trust Creation:

- First, ensure that the entities can communicate with each other.
- Go to AD Administrative Tools -> AD Domain and Trust -> domain -> trust -> new trust.

Commands:
- ipconfig /flushdns: Clears the client resolver cache, removing entries stored in the client's cache.
- ipconfig /displaydns: Shows the entries stored in the client's cache, which are typically websites visited by the client.

Forest-wide Authentication:
- Allows authentication across the entire forest.

Selective Authentication:
- Provides the ability to specify which users or groups from a trusted domain can authenticate against resources in the trusting domain.
