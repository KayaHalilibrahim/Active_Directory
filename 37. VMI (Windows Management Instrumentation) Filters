VMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) Filters:

- We use VMI filters to filter group policy settings.
Example:
- If we want to apply a group policy setting only to computers running Windows 10 or computers with Lenovo brand, we use VMI filters.

The syntax is similar to SQL query syntax.

- On live.sysinternals.com, you can find useful small programs (e.g., programs that convert physical machines to virtual machines).
- Download Bginfo.exe.
- In Bginfo:
  - Go to Custom -> New -> VMI Query.
  - Enter the properties.

For VMI filters:
- Go to VMI filters -> New.
- Enter the Active Directory (AD) details.
- Add queries.
Example query: `select * from Win32_OperatingSystem where Caption like "%Windows 10%"`

The `%` symbol means anything can come before or after.

- VMI filters are applied to group policy object links.
- Select the link.
- At the bottom, find VMI filtering.
Only one VMI filter can be applied to a GP object link.

GPM OBJECTS BACKUP & RESTORE
- To backup a group policy object, go to the group policy object and select Backup.
- You can then import this backup to another machine.
- To restore, use GP Objects -> Manage Backups.
