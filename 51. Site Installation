Site Installation: 

- Open Active Directory Administrative Tools -> Sites -> New Site.
- Connect sites in Active Directory using site links.
- In older setups, replication between DCs could be done via SMTP.
- However, nowadays, transport is done over IP.
- Subnet settings are crucial in determining which DC a request should go to, so IP blocks are entered.
- When creating a new site, don't forget to add IP blocks to the subnet.
