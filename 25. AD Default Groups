AD Default Groups

Enterprise Admins:
- This is the most powerful group in AD (Active Directory).
- It has authority over all domains within the forest.
- It is the most privileged group within the forest.
Schema Admins:
- This group can modify the AD schema.
- An Enterprise Admin is automatically a Schema Admin as well.

Administrator:
- Can access all controllers within the domain.
- Usually, granting permissions to a user is done through the Enterprise or Schema Admin groups.
- Since we create the DC with the Administrator, it is a member of all groups (Enterprise, Schema, etc.).

Domain Admins:
- Has authority only within its own domain.
- Cannot affect other domains within the same forest.

Account Operators:
- Have specific privileges within a domain.
- They can create, delete, and modify users.
- They can add users to newly created groups (e.g., adding members to an accounting group), but they cannot add users to the Domain Admins group.
