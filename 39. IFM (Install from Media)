IFM (Install from Media):

- During the installation of an Additional Domain Controller (DC), the initial replication can take a long time (there could be thousands of users or computers).
- We can speed up replication by preparing and providing a media-like representation of the replication.
- Use the following steps with ntdsutil:
  - Open ntdsutil.
  - Activate instance ntds.
  - Use the "ifm" command to prepare the IFM media.
  - Create the Sysvol directory: `create sysvol c:\IFM`.
  - Quit ntdsutil.
- Copy the IFM media to the target server, typically under `<ComputerName>\c:\`.
- Proceed with promoting this server to a domain controller during the installation.
- To ensure that replication processes from one DC are visible on other DCs, use the command: `repadmin /syncall`.

To determine from which DC a user's computer is being opened:
- Use the command `nltest /sc_query:<DomainName>`.
