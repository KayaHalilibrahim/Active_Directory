Windows Services Restore Mode:

To perform recovery, the computer needs to be opened in restore mode. If you don't know the restore mode password, you'll need to reset it:
- Open cmd and type: ntdsutil -> set dsrm password -> reset password on server <computerName>
- Enter a new password
- Quit

Open the Windows Server Backup tool and select recover.

To open in Restore Mode:
- Go to start -> run -> msconfig -> boot -> safe boot -> Active Directory repair (restore mode) -> restart

Log in with .\administrator to access the admin account in restore mode.

In the Windows Server Backup tool, select local backup -> recover -> system state.

After restoring, other DCs will transfer updated information to the restored DC.

Authorization Restore:
- If you want the restored DC to have priority over other DCs, use authorization restore.
- Go to msconfig -> boot -> safe mode -> AD repair -> log in with .\administrator.
- In Windows Server Backup, select local backup -> recover -> select backup -> system state -> perform an authoritative restore of Active Directory files in the original location -> complete recovery.

Open cmd as an Administrator and enter:
- ntdsutil
- activate instance ntds
- authoritative restore subtree <distinguishedName>: To recover an OU and all objects underneath by increasing version numbers.

For restoring a single object:
- authoritative restore object <distinguishedName>
- Quit (q)
- Q

In msconfig, go to general -> normal start (boot -> remove safe mode).

Full Restore:
- If the DC cannot be opened at all and you have a full backup, perform a full restore.
- Create a new virtual machine and restore the backup to this machine.
