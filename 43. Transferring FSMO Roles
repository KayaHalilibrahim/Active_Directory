Transferring FSMO Roles:

- We use this when we want to retire old domain controllers or if we need to remove a domain controller for any reason.
- The transfer process is carried out on the machine where the roles will be transferred to.

On the command line of the PC to be transferred:
- netdom query fsmo: Shows which DC holds the FSMO roles.

For transferring RID, PDC, and infrastructure roles:
Navigate to Tools -> AD Users and Computers -> Domain -> Operations Master.

For transferring Domain Naming Master:
Navigate to AD Tools -> AD Domain and Trust -> Operations Master.

For transferring Schema Master:
1. Open cmd as an administrator.
2. Register the DLL: `regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll`.
3. Press Windows + R, type `mmc`, and press Enter.
4. Go to File -> Add or Remove Snap-ins -> Active Directory Schema -> Add.
5. In Active Directory Schema, go to Operations Master.
If the DC you want to transfer to is not listed because it's the same as the current one:
- Change the Active Directory Domain Controller to the desired DC.
- In Active Directory Schema -> Operations Master -> Change.

After these operations, AD replication is necessary:
- Go to AD Sites and Services -> Sites -> Default-First-Site-Name -> NTDS Settings (where the FSMO roles were transferred) -> Replicate Now.
