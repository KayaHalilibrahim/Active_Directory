Remote Administration Tools:

Remote Desktop
- Connection is established using port 3389.
- It's important to enable this on the devices you want to connect to, especially on servers.

To connect using Remote Desktop:
- Go to system -> system properties -> allow remote connections.
- Administrative rights are required for Remote Desktop.
- On the device you want to connect to, press Windows+R, type "mstsc" to run the command.
- Connect using the name or IP address.
- Sign out after finishing your work.

Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)
- Used for tasks like creating users and changing passwords, primarily for Account Operators who have specific permissions.
- In cmd, type "whoami /groups" to see the user and the groups they belong to.
- RSAT needs to be installed.
- With RSAT, you can create users without using Remote Desktop for connection.
