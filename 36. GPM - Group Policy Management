GPM - Group Policy Management:

GPM INHERITANCE, ENFORCE, DISABLE
Inheritance:
- Group policy settings follow a top-down inheritance. This means that settings applied at the domain level are inherited by OUs below.

To remove inheritance from the domain level:
- Right-click on the OU and select "Block Inheritance." This prevents settings applied at the domain level from affecting the OU.

Enforce:
- Use "Enforce" when you want a change to be enforced even if there are conflicting settings or lower-level policies that might not accept the change.
- Right-click on the setting and choose "Enforce" to apply this.

To disable a GPM setting:
- Select the setting and then click on "Details" to disable it.

GPM DELEGATION
- After applying a setting to an OU, we use delegation to remove that setting from a specific object within the OU.

Authenticated Users: Represents everyone.
- If within an OU, it represents everyone in that OU.

Steps for delegation:
- Select the setting.
- Go to delegation.
- Add the username (the user for whom you want to remove the setting).
- Apply group policy and set it to "deny."
