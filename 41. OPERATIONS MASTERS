OPERATIONS MASTERS:

- If the first DC we install crashes, the structure may not function properly.
- Also known as FSMO (Flexible Single Master Operation) roles.
- In an AD structure, there are 2 forest-based and 3 domain-based FSMO roles, totaling 5 FSMO roles.
- The schema master and domain naming master are located in the root domain.

FSMO ROLES:
- Schema master
- Domain naming master
- PDC master
- RID master
- Infrastructure master

- `netdom query fsmo`: Displays machines hosting FSMO roles. Migration can be performed.
- They are generally found on the machine where we initially installed them by default.
- While we can distribute these roles, they are typically kept on a single machine for security reasons.
