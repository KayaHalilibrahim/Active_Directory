Group Creation

Groups are used to manage permissions and access rights. Instead of adding individual users to folder permissions, we add groups.

Group Types:
- Security Groups: Used for granting permissions.
- Distribution Groups: Used only for email purposes.

Group Scope:
Domain Local:
- If permissions are granted, they can access resources only within their own domain.

Global Group:
- If permissions are granted, they can access resources in all domains within the same forest.

Universal Group:
- Used to control access to resources across different domains.

Steps:
A - G - DL - P: Create an account - Add to global group - Add to Domain Local group - Set permissions
                   Or
A - G - U - DL - P: Create an account - Add to global group - Add to Universal group - Add to Domain Local group - Set permissions
