Creating Group Policy:

- You need to be a member of the minimum group policy creator owner group.

Opening a Port on the Firewall:
- Open Group Policy Management.
- Go to Group Policy Objects, where all group policy settings are located.
- Click on "New," enter a name, then edit settings for user/computer.
- Navigate to Windows Security > Windows Firewall with Advanced Security > Inbound > New:
  - Select the port and specify its details.

Applying the Group Policy:
- Go to the Domain or OU where you want to apply the policy.
- Select "Link an Existing GPO" and choose the group policy you created.
- You can also drag and drop the policy.

Updating Group Policy on Client Computers:
- Right-click on the OU and select "Group Policy Update" to ensure client computers get the updated policy. (This cannot be done at the domain level.)

Managing Group Policy:
- Use Group Policy Management to access Computer Configuration > Preferences > Local Users and Groups to manage local groups on computers.

Default Behavior:
- By default, any user can join a computer to the domain up to 10 times without being a Domain Admin.

Delegating Control:
- Use delegation to grant a user without privileges the ability to join an unlimited number of computers to the domain:
  - Right-click on the Domain Name > Delegate Control > Add the group > Select "Join a computer to the domain" option.

Making a User a Local Administrator on Their Computer:
- Open Group Policy Management and edit the necessary settings.
- Navigate to Computer Configuration > Local Users and Groups > New Local Group.
  - Create a group named "Administrator" and add the user to it.
- This grants local admin privileges to the user on all computers.
- Additionally, you can use item-level targeting for specific computers by specifying their names.
