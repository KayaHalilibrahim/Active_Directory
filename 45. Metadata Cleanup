Metadata Cleanup:

- Used to remove traces of unused DCs and clean up the metadata in the database of the DC from which FSMO roles were seized.
- Also used to sever connections between the crashed DC and other DCs.
- For example, if the crashed DC still appears in the Domain Controller, we use this tool.

Steps for Metadata Cleanup:
1. Open `ntdsutil`.
2. Type `metadata cleanup`.
3. Enter `connections`.
4. Connect to the working DC using `connect to <DCName>`.
5. Type `quit`.
6. Select the operation target.
7. List the domains using `list domain`.
8. Select the domain using `select domain <number>`.
9. List the sites using `list sites`.
10. Select the site using `select site <number>`.
11. List the servers in the site using `list server in site`.
12. Select the server that is not working or has crashed using `select server <number>`.
13. Type `quit`.
14. Remove the selected server using `remove selected server`.
