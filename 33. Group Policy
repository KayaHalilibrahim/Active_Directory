GROUP POLICY:

Group Policy allows us to configure settings for users and computers in Active Directory (AD).
- It is used for making bulk configuration changes on users and computers.
- It is applied for a group of settings collectively.
- We use Group Policy Management in AD for managing group policies.

By default, AD comes with two group policies:
1. Default Domain Controllers Policy: This is crucial for password policy settings.
2. Default Domain Policy

Group Policy settings include:
1. Computer configuration
2. User configuration

- Group Policy settings are applied every 90-120 minutes.
- To apply Group Policy changes immediately on client computers, open Command Prompt and use the command:
gpupdate /force

- The Group Policy settings we configure apply to the local settings of all computers:
To access local security policies on a computer, use Windows + r and type gpedit.msc.

Account Lockout Policy Settings:
These settings include configurations that users should pay attention to when logging in.
