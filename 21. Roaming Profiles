Roaming Profiles:

- User profiles are by default stored under C:\Users on each user's computer.
- Profile documents are located here.
- Profile documents contain users' documents and created files.

- If a user wants to see their profile on all computers they have logged into, they should use Roaming Profiles.

- Create a folder named Profiles under the C drive.
- Then go to the user's profile on the server:

Profile path: \\<ipAddress>\profiles\%username%

- Instead of %username%, we can also use the name directly, but this can cause issues if there are multiple names.
- We can use the computer name instead of the IP address, but using the IP address is better.
