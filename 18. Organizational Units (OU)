Organizational Units (OU)

- They are structures that contain objects such as users, computers, and groups.
- We can apply group policy settings.
- <domainName> -> New -> Organizational Unit
- We can create nested OUs.
- By enabling View -> Advanced Features, we can see hidden features. This allows us to delete a protected OU in this way.
