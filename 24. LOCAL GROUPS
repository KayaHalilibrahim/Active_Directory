LOCAL GROUPS

- On a client PC, go to Computer Management.
- Local users and groups are not available on a DC (Domain Controller).
- You can create a new user by selecting "New Users."
- When you join a machine to the domain, the domain users group on the domain becomes a member of the local users group on that machine.
- If you make a user a member of the Domain Admins group on the DC, they become an Administrator on their own computer.

To make a user an admin on their own computer:
- We make these users local admins on their machines.
- To make someone a local admin, you need to log in with an authorized user.
- To make someone a local admin:
  - On the client PC, go to "Computer Management" -> "Local Users and Groups" -> "Groups" -> "Add."
- The user becomes an authorized user on their own machine.
- This process can also be done using DC policy.
