- If you want a script to run when a user starts their computer, you can use a logon script.
- It is located in the user's properties -> profile tab.
- It is connected to the netlogon folder.
- The script runs every time the user logs in.
- The script should have a .vbs extension.
- Open Windows Run (window+r) -> go to the kaya.local domain.
- Place the script in the netlogon folder.
- Go to the user's properties -> profile -> logon script and write just the name of the script.
