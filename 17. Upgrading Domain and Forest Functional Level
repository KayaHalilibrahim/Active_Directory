Upgrading Domain Functional Level and Forest Functional Level:

Start -> Administrative Tools -> AD Administrative Center:

- <domainName> -> Raise the Forest Functional Level and Raise the Domain Functional Level
- Start -> Administrative Tools -> AD Domain and Trust
- Right-click on <domainName> and select Raise Domain Functional Level
- Right-click on Active Directory Domains and Trusts and select Raise Forest Functional Level
- You cannot raise the level if there are low-level controllers in the structure.
- If we raise the level, we cannot revert to a lower level later.

*Start -> Administrative Tools -> AD for Windows PowerShell -> Right-click and run as Administrator.
In the command line:

Get-ADForest: Get information about the forest level.
Get-ADDomain: Get information about the domain level.
(Get-ADDomain).DomainMode: Shows the domain mode.
If we only upgrade the forest, the domain will automatically upgrade as well.
