Active Directory Site Concept:

- Sites contain DCs (Domain Controllers).
- Used to prevent network fragmentation.
- It's based on physical locations in the network.
- For example, different office buildings or geographical locations of a company can each form a site.

Making a Server a Router:
- First, create two switches and configure the settings for routing in the routing device.
- You need two internet adapters.
- Open Server Manager -> Add Roles and Features -> Remote Access -> Routing -> Install -> Restart.

Go to Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Routing and Remote Access -> Routing (local) -> Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access -> Custom Configuration -> LAN Routing -> Finish.
