Seizing Operations Master Roles:

- If a DC crashes and there is no backup, we need to seize the Operations Master roles (FSM).

On the command line:
- Open `ntdsutil`.
- Type `roles` (should show `ntdsutil:`).
- Type `connections` (should show `fsmo maintenance:`).
- Connect to the server using `connect to server <DCName>` (replace `<DCName>` with the name of the working DC).
- Type `quit` to go back to the previous page.
- Use `seize pdc` to seize the PDC Emulator role (should show `fsmo maintenance:`).
- Use `seize RID Master` to seize the RID Master role.
- Use `seize infrastructure master` to seize the Infrastructure Master role.
- Use `seize schema master` to seize the Schema Master role.
- Use `seize naming master` to seize the Domain Naming Master role.
