ADDITIONAL DC INSTALLATION:

- By setting up an Additional Domain Controller (DC), you can ensure continuity in case your primary infrastructure fails.
- To set up an Additional DC, you first install a server machine and configure its name and network settings, then join it to the domain.
- Start by selecting "Add Roles and Features" and install Active Directory (AD).
- Next, promote this server to a domain controller.
- Choose "Add a domain controller to an existing domain."
- If a machine is a DC, it also functions as a DNS server simultaneously.
