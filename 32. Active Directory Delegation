Active Directory Delegation:

Active Directory (AD) Delegation is used when we want to grant specific permissions to a user or group for a particular group or Organizational Unit (OU) in AD.
- We use it to grant permissions only in a specific area if we want to give a user access to create users or groups only in a specific OU, such as Ankara OU, without using the Domain Users group.
- Delegation can be applied to OUs.
- To delegate permissions, go to the top level of the OU, right-click, select Delegation Control, then choose the group or user.
- After that, select the permissions you want to grant.

To remove permissions:
- First, go to View -> Advanced Features
- Then go to the OU where you granted the permissions -> properties -> security -> advanced
- Select the user and click "remove" to delete the permissions.
