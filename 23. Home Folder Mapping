Home Folder Mapping:

- We use mapped folders for folders that we don't want to lose access to over the network.
- After creating the folder, we grant access to the user we want to access it.
- The user with access can create a drive on their computer using This PC -> Map network drive and access the folder by entering its path.
- However, this can only be done on the PCs we have granted permission to.

Home Folder:

- It is commonly used for corporate data.
- Go to the user's profile on the server.
- Click on Connect.
- Enter \\<ipAddress>\<folderName>\%username% as the path.
- %username% allows each PC to create its own folder with its username.

Creating Users with Similar Properties:

- To create a user with similar properties to an existing user, we can copy the user we created earlier.
- They will be in the same groups and have the same permissions.
